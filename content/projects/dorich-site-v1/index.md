My first acquaintance with web technologies.

At that moment, I was immersed in creating video and believed that I needed a site with a presentation of myself as a specialist in development and video creation at the same time. A site where the user could see examples of my work, see the prices for my services, get acquainted with my work pipeline and send a request for cooperation. Support for different languages was also planned.

The idea was good and interesting, but I stumbled upon a lack of experience with the technologies used. At first I created static pages, then I transferred everything to a single page application. Maintainability only suffered from this.

Previously, this site occupied this address, and it can be considered the very first version. I manually placed the images for it in the project repository, and now they are no longer here of course, so I see no reason to launch this project for viewing at a different address, but you can familiarize yourself with the client's source code to compare my skills then and today.
