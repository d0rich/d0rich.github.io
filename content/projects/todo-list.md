This is one of the tasks that I performed during the passage of the Smart World Academy (a project of an IT company from Tomsk for training potential employees).

This app is a to-do list created in collaboration with another member who has implemented an API for accessing and modifying data. I was creating an application client.

The functionality of the application allows you to:
- create to-do lists;
- delete to-do lists;
- visually distinguish to-do lists with different statuses;
- sort to-do lists by status;
- plan to-do items on the to-do list;
- remove cases from the to-do list;
- to record the execution of the case.

P.S. The application is only available in Russian, but if you need, there is a Google translator.
