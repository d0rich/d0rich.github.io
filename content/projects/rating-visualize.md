The application visualizes the results of the qualifying round 
of the [Olympiads 20/21 from the website of Tomsk State University](http://abiturient.tsu.ru/ru/content/results-ORMO).

To get acquainted with the results on a specific subject, you 
can download the excel table from their website, or select from 
the files already inside the application.

The histogram shows how many people scored points in a certain 
interval by participant countries, and on the pie chart - the ratio 
of the number of people with diplomas of different degrees. Graphs are 
interactive - you can hide some datasets for easy viewing.

The loaded table with the results is also displayed, where you can 
sort the data by each of the columns.

P.S. The application is only available in Russian, but if you need, 
there is a Google translator.

P.P.S. Results tables published after the application was written may 
not work due to the changed format.
