In September 2020, I became a member of the Smart World Academy 
(a project of an IT company from Tomsk for training potential employees) 
in the frontend direction.

Actually, this project is the very first task that had to be done.

It was necessary to make up the site according to the sketch, it was 
forbidden to use any libraries other than jQuery (here I got to know it in practice).

Of course, the layout was provided only for the average 
computer monitor, the layout for other screens had to be invented independently.

P.S. I doubt I'll ever need jQuery again.
