I needed a resource that would demonstrate my web development competence in 
itself and simply by describing what I can.

Here information is provided directly about me, here projects 
that I want to share with others are collected, here resumes have 
been worked out for possible responses to vacancies. It is also planned 
to create a blog with related functionality.

You cannot try most of the functionality, since it is related to 
data editing and is available only to me. However, be sure everything 
is beautifully done :).

This is the project in which I put the most of my heart. I 
am constantly improving it, so the project completion date will change. 
When writing new functionality, I try to use some new technology for myself, 
so as not to stand still. And of course I try to make it comfortable, 
I hope you felt it :).

P.S. You are on this site right now :).
