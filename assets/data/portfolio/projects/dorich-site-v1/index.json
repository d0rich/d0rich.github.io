A site where the user could see examples of my work, see the prices for my services, get acquainted with my work pipeline and send a request for cooperation. Support for different languages was also planned.</p>\n<p>The idea was good and interesting, but I stumbled upon a lack of experience with the technologies used. At first I created static pages, then I transferred everything to a single page application. Maintainability only suffered from this.</p>\n<p>Previously, this site occupied this address, and it can be considered the very first version. I manually placed the images for it in the project repository, and now they are no longer here of course, so I see no reason to launch this project for viewing at a different address, but you can familiarize yourself with the client's source code to compare my skills then and today.</p>\n","summary":"","tags":[{"title":"frontend","path":"/portfolio/tags/frontend/"},{"title":"backend","path":"/portfolio/tags/backend/"},{"title":"legacy","path":"/portfolio/tags/legacy/"},{"title":"prod","path":"/portfolio/tags/prod/"}],"technologies":[{"title":"Vue.js","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Vue.js/"},{"title":"Express","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Express/"},{"title":"Node.js","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Node.js/"},{"title":"Firebase","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Firebase/"},{"title":"MongoDB","path":"/portfolio/technologies/MongoDB/"},{"title":"Mongoose","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Mongoose/"}],"related":[{"title":"Source code on GitHub","icon":"mdi-github","href":"https://github.com/d0rich/dorich-site-legacy"}]}},"context":{}}
