We could have come up with the system ourselves, and therefore, having just got acquainted with web technologies (Vue, Express, MongoDb, MSSQL), I planned to create, in fact, a whole social network.</p>\n<p>The idea was as follows: a network where trainers of sports groups could create events for their groups, make announcements with the ability to create a link to an event, create invitation codes for groups, and keep records of various types. The athletes were also not deprived and had the opportunity of various kinds of communications.</p>\n<p>As a result, you can register in the application (there is even an email check); algorithms for authorization via JSON Web Token were learned and created from scratch; a calendar has been implemented where you can create events, share and make notes; the group news feed with filters has been recreated.</p>\n<p>Of course, I could not create a full-fledged application (at least the news feed requires pagination), but I think it was a worthy attempt :).</p>\n<p>Below you can view the application itself and the client's source code to track my progress in coding. Maybe someday I will remove confidential data from the server code and also make it public.</p>\n<p>P.S. The application is available only in Russian, but, if you need, there is a Google translator.</p>\n<p>P.P.S. For practice I got the highest mark :)</p>\n","summary":"","tags":[{"title":"frontend","path":"/portfolio/tags/frontend/"},{"title":"backend","path":"/portfolio/tags/backend/"},{"title":"learn","path":"/portfolio/tags/learn/"},{"title":"legacy","path":"/portfolio/tags/legacy/"}],"technologies":[{"title":"Vue.js","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Vue.js/"},{"title":"Vuetify","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Vuetify/"},{"title":"Node.js","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Node.js/"},{"title":"Express","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Express/"},{"title":"Sequelize ORM","path":"/portfolio/technologies/Sequelize%20ORM/"},{"title":"PostgreSQL","path":"/portfolio/technologies/PostgreSQL/"}],"related":[{"title":"Working project","icon":"mdi-desktop-mac-dashboard","href":"https://sport-org.herokuapp.com/"},{"title":"Source code on GitHub","icon":"mdi-github","href":"https://github.com/d0rich/sport-organizer-client"}]}},"context":{}}
